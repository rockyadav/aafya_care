                        <h2>What We Do?</h2>
                        <h4>Food Security</h4>
                        <h4>Boundary less Infrastructure</h4>
                        <p class="desc">Many nations from the least developing regions of the world are caught in a vicious cycle of poverty and despair. A major step in fighting poverty and boosting development is to provide infrastructure which includes roads, railways, and seaports/airports. Roads, ports and railways can provide the vital links to connect Africa/Middle East, South Asia and East Asia. Trading zones can be created along borders between countries and regions. Numerous benefits can be enjoyed through cross-border trade. Value-added goods through cottage and small & medium industries can be developed or manufactured using the available raw materials and resources can be traded through this network of roads and railways. Eventually, this will enable trade to flow freely across open borders. This will also promote understanding, tolerance and friendship among nations. Far flung and forgotten peoples living in the most remote places can see a change in their lives. Economic development would act as catalyst to promote prosperity amongst the peoples of nations and this would be a major step in eradicating poverty and boosting development.</p>
                        <p class="desc">IIC will embark on this program with the co-operation of nations, organizations, corporate bodies and institutions.</p>
                        <h4>Education for All</h4>
                        <p class="desc">Article 26 of The Universal Declaration of Human Rights clearly spells out that "Everyone has a right to education.” Education shall be free at least in the elementary and fundamental stages and elementary education shall be compulsory. Higher education shall be equally accessible to all on the basis of merit.</p>
                        <p class="desc">It further states that "education shall be directed to the full development of the human personality and to the strengthening of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.” Also, "parents have a prior right to choose the kind of education that shall be given to their children.”</p>
                        <p class="desc">We at IIC have plans to develop education cities or learning and development zones to cater to the needs of people who are disadvantaged and to all deserving citizens wherever they come from.</p>
