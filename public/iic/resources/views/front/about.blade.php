                        <p class="desc">IIC is an asset-based investment consortium which focuses on design and finance. We currently have a presence in over 67 countries worldwide and have experience in delivering large scale projects in an efficient and effective manner. We take a long-term approach to our investment strategy,and we focus on empowering the people’s economy and creating global peace and prosperity through economic justice for all. When we are assessing the viability of our projects, financial viability is only one of the metrics that we look at in tandem with social and economic considerations which are paramount in our decision-making process. Our investment model is not based on the traditional model of lending which only results in burdening countries with unsustainable debt obligations. We work with governments to create a loan-free economy which does not need to rely on debt to drive investment and development. Our aim is to create an environment which is attractive to all international investors and businesses, both foreign and domestic.</p>
